## The capture experience

Most task managers make you pay a tax every time you capture: switch app, wait for it to load, find the input field, pick a project, set a date, close the dialog. **horae eliminates that tax entirely.**

```
$ horae -f
```

That's it. Flash mode opens **directly on the input line** — no splash screen, no list view, no navigation.
Start typing and the cursor is already blinking. Fill in the task, press Enter. Done. The window closes.

```
dentist appointment ~fri 14:00 @health !high ↵
✓ captured  (#a3f)                              [horae exits]
```

**Time from idea to captured: under 10 seconds.**

### Why so fast?

horae is a **Rust binary with ~2 ms of startup overhead** — the font probe reads font directories directly instead of shelling out, settings load in a single batched SQL query, and input-method detection runs on a background thread so it never blocks the cursor.

### Reactive completions, no Tab required

Type `@`, `~`, `*`, or `!` and a completion panel appears instantly — no Tab, no delay.

```
dentist appointment ~fr█
                    ┌──────────────────────────┐
                    │ ~fri    → this Friday     │  ← highlighted
                    │ ~fri2   → next Friday     │
                    │ ~friday → (same as ~fri)  │
                    └──────────────────────────┘
```

`Tab` accepts the top candidate. `Up`/`Down` (or Vim `j`/`k`) moves through the list.
`Enter` completes **and** submits in one keystroke — zero extra keypresses.

Two completion styles (toggle under `F7`):
- **Reference** — token, meaning and a syntax example shown side-by-side
- **Speed** — compact list with ghost text inlined directly in the input

### The full syntax, on one line

```
buy milk @home ~today 18:00 *2w[1,3] !high
│         │     │            │        └─ priority
│         │     │            └────────── recurrence: every 2 weeks, Mon+Wed
│         │     └─────────────────────── scheduled time  (start or deadline)
│         └───────────────────────────── tag
└─────────────────────────────────────── title
```

Tokens can be in any order. Full-width punctuation (`＠ ～ ＊ ！`) is accepted too — Chinese IME users never need to switch to half-width.

A GTD task manager built in Rust: one binary with an embedded SQLite database, a CLI, and a [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs) TUI. No server, no account, no telemetry — everything lives in `~/.config/horae/`.

Nothing about a task is ever lost: every status change, reschedule and check-in is stamped with a UTC-millisecond timestamp and appended to an append-only `task_events` timeline. `horae show <id>` replays the full history.

## Install

**npm** — prebuilt binaries, no Rust toolchain required:

```sh
npx horae-cli              # run without installing
npm install -g horae-cli   # install globally
```

**Cargo** — requires Rust 1.89+; SQLite is bundled, no C dependencies:

```sh
cargo install horae
cargo install --git https://github.com/zhaohang1205/horae   # latest main
```

Inside China the Gitee mirror is faster: `cargo install --git https://gitee.com/zhao-hang1205/hora.git`.

**From source:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zhaohang1205/horae.git
cd horae
cargo build --release      # binary: target/release/horae
```

Two things worth knowing before the first run:

- Icons are Nerd Font glyphs. On startup `horae` probes installed fonts and falls back to plain ASCII if none is found, so you never see tofu boxes. Force a style with `HORAE_ICONS=nerd|ascii`.
- Desktop notifications use native D-Bus notifications (`org.freedesktop.Notifications`) and are Linux-only (avoiding command-line argument leakage). On Windows the TUI alarms, the pomodoro timer and ntfy pushes still work; data is stored under `%APPDATA%\horae\`.

## Quick start

```sh
horae capture "buy milk @home ~today 18:00 !medium"
horae list --status next
horae do --start           # recommend one task, then start a pomodoro
horae done "buy milk"
horae show <id>            # details + full event timeline
horae                      # open the TUI
```

Commands that take a task accept a **full id**, a **unique id prefix** (git-style), or a **unique exact title**; an ambiguous title is an error rather than a guess. Archived tasks can only be addressed by id.

## Capture

Getting a thought out of your head is the one interaction you repeat hundreds of times a day, so it is the path `horae` optimizes hardest. Four ways in, all accepting the same one-line syntax:

| Situation | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Already in a shell | `horae capture "buy milk @home ~today 18:00"` (`c`) | quotes are optional: `horae c buy milk @home` works |
| Want a box, not a terminal argument | `horae -f` / `horae flash` (`f`) | opens straight on the input line; Enter saves and exits, Esc drops into the list instead |
| Already in the TUI | `a` | capture without leaving the current view |
| Text is on the clipboard | `horae capture --clip` | short text becomes the title; long text keeps its first ~30 characters as the title and stores the rest in notes |

Pasting into the TUI works the same way: paste in any list view and it opens the input line with that text already in it.

### Speed

Everything between "typed the command" and "cursor is blinking" is kept out of the way:

- Startup work before the first frame costs about 2 ms — the font probe reads font directories directly instead of shelling out to `fc-list`, the input-method switch runs on a background thread, and settings load in one batched query. The icon choice is cached in the settings table on first run.
- Flash mode skips the splash screen and lands directly on the input line.
- Invalid input never reaches the database. A time expression that does not parse, or a recurrence rule the engine cannot expand, is reported inline and nothing is written.
- Nothing waits on the network. `capture` is a single local transaction.

### Typing

- Full-width punctuation (`＠ ～ ＊ ！ ［ ］ ：`) is normalized, so a Chinese IME stays usable without switching to half-width. Where possible the input line is switched to English input automatically, asynchronously.
- Completion pops up by itself as soon as you type `@`, `~`, `*` or `!` — no Tab required. `Tab` accepts the highlighted candidate, `Up`/`Down` (or `Ctrl+n`/`Ctrl+p`, `Ctrl+j`/`Ctrl+k`, `Alt+n`/`Alt+p`, `PageUp`/`PageDown`) move through the list, and `Esc`, `Ctrl+E` or `Ctrl+G` dismisses it. `Enter` completes the highlighted candidate and then submits.
- Two completion styles are available under `F7`: a reference card with the token, its meaning and a syntax example, or a compact speed list with ghost text inline in the input line.
- Full Emacs-style line editing: `Ctrl+a`/`Ctrl+e` (start/end), `Ctrl+b`/`Ctrl+f`, `Ctrl+w` (delete word back), `Ctrl+u`/`Ctrl+k`, `Ctrl+h`/`Ctrl+d`, plus `Home`/`End` and the arrow keys.
- Zen capture hides the surrounding chrome while you type. It is on by default.

### Corrections

Right after a capture, `u` undoes it — the toast tells you so. The same key undoes the last checklist tick, archive or restore, so capturing carelessly costs nothing.

### Capture settings

Toggles under `F7` in the TUI, persisted per database:

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start in capture | off | launching `horae` lands on the input line instead of a list — this is what `horae -f` does for one run |
| Flash mode | off | Enter saves and exits instead of returning to the list |
| Zen capture | on | hide list chrome while typing |
| Completion style | Reference | card vs. compact list with ghost text |
| Password mode | off | require password authentication to open app or view data; press L in TUI to lock screen |

## Concepts

### Status lifecycle

```text
Inbox → Next / Scheduled / Waiting / Someday / Reference → Done
```

A freshly captured task lands in `Inbox`. Clarifying it moves it to one of the actionable or non-actionable states, and each transition stamps the matching `*_at` column. Because every transition, reschedule and check-in carries its own UTC-ms timestamp, the timeline doubles as a time record of the task's life: you can see how long it sat unclarified in the inbox, when it was rescheduled, and when it was finally done.

### Archive vs. purge

- **Archive** (`horae archive`, aliases `rm` / `delete`) is a soft delete: it sets `archived_at` and an archive reason, keeps the task and its timeline, and is undone with `horae restore`.
- **Purge** (`horae purge`) is a hard delete and only works on already-archived tasks. It removes the task together with its events, tags and child rows, and logs nothing — there is no undo.

### Effective due

Sorting, filtering, alarms and the daily summary all use the *effective* due, not the raw `due_at` column. For a recurring task that is the most recently missed occurrence if one is outstanding, otherwise the next one. For everything else it is `due_at`, falling back to `scheduled_start_at`.

## Quick-add syntax

The same one-line parser runs everywhere text is accepted: CLI `capture` and `modify`, the TUI input bar, the phone sync files, and Feishu messages.

```text
buy milk @home ~today 18:00 *2w[1,3] !high
```

- `buy milk` — title
- `@home` — tag
- `~today 18:00` — scheduled start
- `*2w[1,3]` — recurrence rule
- `!high` — priority

Tokens can appear in any order.

Full-width punctuation (`＠ ～ ＊ ！ ［ ］ ：`) is accepted too, so a Chinese IME does not have to switch to half-width.

### Time (`~`)

`~time` sets the planned start (`scheduled_start_at`) and moves the task into `Scheduled`. `--due` sets a deadline (`due_at`) instead. A date without a clock time defaults to 09:00.

| Syntax | Examples | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offset | `now`, `+30m`, `+2h`, `+1d`, `+1w` | offset from now; units are `m` `h` `d` `w` |
| Offset + clock | `+3d 15:30` | offset by days, then anchor to a clock time |
| Day words | `today`, `tomorrow`, `今天`, `明天`, `后天` | that calendar day |
| Weekdays | `mon`–`sun`, `next fri`, `周一`–`周日`, `下周一` | nearest matching weekday; `next` adds a week |
| Clock | `18:00` | today, or tomorrow if that time already passed |
| Dates | `8/20`, `2026.8.20`, `2026-07-24 14:30` | absolute date, optional time |

### Recurrence (`*`)

| Shorthand | Expands to |
| --- | --- |
| `*d` `*w` `*m` `*y` | `FREQ=DAILY` / `WEEKLY` / `MONTHLY` / `YEARLY` |
| `*2d` `*3w` | same with `INTERVAL=2` / `3` |
| `*weekday` / `*weekend` | `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR` / `SA,SU` |
| `*2w[1,3]` | every two weeks on Monday and Wednesday (1–7 = Mon–Sun) |
| `*1w[mo,we]` | weekly on Monday and Wednesday, by name |
| `*m[1,-1]` `*m[1,15]` | monthly on given days; negative counts from month end |
| `*y[jan,jul]` | yearly in January and July |
| `*2y[6]` | every two years in June |

Only `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY` and `YEARLY` are supported, and every write path validates the rule before it reaches the database — an unsupported frequency is an error, never a silent downgrade. Completing a recurring task does not finish it: a check-in is recorded and the anchor advances to the next occurrence. A habit can only be checked in once per day.

### Priority (`!`)

`!high` (also `!h`, `!1`, `!高`), `!medium` (`!m`, `!2`, `!中`), `!low` (`!l`, `!3`, `!低`). Priority is a dedicated `tasks.priority` column, not a tag; clear it with `--clear-priority`.

Global flags apply everywhere: `--profile <name>` selects the data set, `--lang zh` (or `HORAE_LANG=zh`) prints help in Chinese, and `--theme <name>` (or `HORAE_THEME=<name>`) sets the UI theme (`catppuccin`, `latte`, `tokyo-night`, `gruvbox`, `retro-82`, or `auto`).

## TUI

Running `horae` opens a three-pane layout: navigation on the left, the task list in the middle, details and the event timeline on the right.

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `h` `j` `k` `l` / arrows | move between panes and through the list |
| `0`–`9` | switch view: `1` Inbox, `2` Next, `3` Scheduled, `4` Waiting, `5` Someday, `6` Reference, `7` Done, `8` Archive, `9` Tags, `0` Quotes |
| `J` / `K` | jump to Today / Tomorrow |
| `g` / `G` | jump to first / last row |
| `a` | capture (quick-add syntax works here) |
| `Enter` / `e` | organize / edit the selected task |
| `n` | edit notes in `$EDITOR` |
| `C` | add a checklist item |
| `Tab` | manage checklist items (`j`/`k` move, `Space` toggles, `d` deletes, `J`/`K` reorder, `e` renames) |
| `=` | tick the next uncompleted checklist item |
| `x` / `w` / `s` | done / waiting / someday |
| `A` | archive (`y` to confirm); `u` restores; `D` purges inside the Archive view |
| `v` | visual multi-select; `Space` toggles a row, `Ctrl+a` selects all, `Ctrl+u` inverts, `T` bulk-tags |
| `P` / `S` | start or continue a pomodoro / stop it |
| `[` | configure pomodoro intervals (`25;5;15;4`) |
| `r` / `R` | weekly review; `R` advances to the next step |
| `"` | add to / remove from Quotes (when the feature is enabled) |
| `/` / `f` | search text / filter by tag |
| `F1` or `?` | keybinding help |
| `F5` / `F6` / `F7` | theme / language / feature toggles |
| `M` | settings view (profile management) |
| `W` | GTD workflow view |
| `Ctrl+P` | syntax cheat sheet |
| `Esc` / `q` | cancel / quit |

In the Tags view, `c` creates a tag and `D` deletes one. In the Settings view, `n` creates a profile, `r` renames, `d` deletes, `s` sets the default, `b` toggles sound effects, and `p` configures password protection.

Today and Tomorrow are deliberately strict: both only contain `Next` and `Scheduled` tasks. Today is the union of overdue tasks and tasks whose window falls inside today; Tomorrow contains only tasks scheduled inside tomorrow's window, with no carry-over of unfinished work.

## Focus recommendation

`horae do` (alias `focus`) scores every active task and prints the single highest one; `--start` also launches a pomodoro for it.

It first drops `Someday`, `Reference`, `Done`, quotes, and any `Scheduled` or `Waiting` task that is neither due nor overdue. What remains is scored as:

| Factor | Points |
| --- | --- |
| Priority `high` / `medium` / `low` | +10000 / +5000 / +1000 |
| Overdue | +2000, plus +10 per day overdue (capped at +500) |
| Due today | +1000 |
| Status `Next` | +500 |

Ties are broken by `created_at`, oldest first.

## Pomodoro

```sh
horae pomo start <id>   # 25-minute session on a task; spawns a background daemon
horae pomo stop
horae pomo waybar       # JSON for a waybar module
```

The daemon ticks once a second, writes `~/.config/horae/pomo.json`, and sends a desktop notification when a phase ends. `horae stats` shows today's count.

## Calendar

`horae calendar` prints the lunar date, the current solar term and upcoming holiday countdowns from a built-in 1900–2100 table — no network access involved. `--short` gives a one-line summary suitable for a login banner, `--json` gives structured output. Major holidays are flagged in the TUI banner and desktop notifications three days and one day ahead.

## Quotes

An opt-in feature (off by default, toggled under `F7`) for keeping quotes and reference fragments. A quote is a `reference` task tagged `@quote`; it only ever appears in the Quotes view (`0`) and never in the inbox or action lists. Capturing anything with `@quote` routes it there.

## Profiles

A profile is an independent SQLite file, so work and personal data can be kept apart.

```sh
horae profile list
horae profile new work
horae profile set-default work
horae --profile work capture "buy milk"
```

The TUI settings view (`M`) does the same with `n` / `r` / `d` / `s`. Switching takes effect on the next launch. Configuration lives in `~/.config/horae/config.json`; the database file is never touched by profile commands.

## Phone capture and notifications

### Syncthing folder bridge

Sync `~/.config/horae/sync` with your phone and run `horae watch` on the computer (in systemd, tmux, or autostart). Every few seconds it reconciles the folder:

| File | Direction | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `capture.txt` | phone writes | one quick-add line per task |
| `actions.txt` | phone writes | `done <id>`, `set <id> status next`, `set <id> due <time>` |
| `today.md` | computer writes | snapshot of active and overdue tasks |
| `reminders/*.md` | computer writes | a file per due task, which itself triggers a sync notification on the phone |

It polls rather than watching inotify because Syncthing writes via atomic rename, and consumed lines get a `.done` receipt so a crash cannot replay them.

### ntfy

Add an `ntfy` block to a profile in `config.json`, subscribe to the topic in the ntfy app, then keep `horae watch` running. Timed tasks push a native notification `lead_minutes` before they are due. The token is read from the environment (`token_env`) and never written to disk.

```json
{
  "default_profile": "default",
  "profiles": {
    "default": {
      "db": "horae.db",
      "ntfy": {
        "url": "https://ntfy.sh",
        "topic": "horae-my-private-topic",
        "token_env": "HORAE_NTFY_TOKEN",
        "priority": 5,
        "lead_minutes": 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Check it with `horae ntfy test`.

### Feishu / Lark

Configure a `feishu` block and `horae watch` will push due-task cards and a daily briefing. `horae feishu listen` opens a WebSocket long connection so you can capture tasks by messaging the bot and act on cards from your phone, without a public IP. `horae feishu doctor` checks credentials and connectivity; `horae feishu sync` reconciles with Feishu Tasks v2.

## Backup

```sh
horae export --file ~/horae-backup.json   # tasks, events, tags, settings, pomodoro
horae import ~/horae-backup.json          # merge; existing ids are skipped
horae import --replace ~/horae-backup.json # wipe and restore exactly
```

## Where data lives

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.config/horae/horae.db` | default SQLite database |
| `~/.config/horae/config.json` | profiles and their integration config |
| `~/.config/horae/pomo.json` | pomodoro runtime state |
| `~/.config/horae/sync/` | phone bridge folder |

`HORAE_CONFIG_DIR` overrides the whole directory. On Windows the default is `%APPDATA%\horae\`.
